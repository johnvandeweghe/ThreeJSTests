# ThreeJSTests
I had some time during a physics class I was taking, so I played with ThreeJS. There is even a small amount of physics simulation.

Open the html file to watch the simulation, some may not work, as they were just tests to play with threejs.

Some of them let you move the camera, to do so use wsad to pan, qe to turn, and shift/space to go down/up respectivly.
